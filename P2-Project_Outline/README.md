# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a kid, did you ever beg your parent for a new pet? Your parents may have responded with "You won't take care of it, I know I will end up doing all the work." How can a parent hold their child accountable? How can a child prove their dedication to their new pet? Petsi! Petsi is a website where users (the child) can register their pet and log acitivities/pet care events. This will allow children to visualize what they have done with their pet, and hopefully encourage them to do more and more. 
### Features
-Create a pet object (Pet parent class, species as child classes)
-Will support a few types of pets: dog, cat, reptile/amphibian, rodent, (and perhaps) bird, fish
-Log events
-Check events (maybe in a weekly calendar format?)
-Activities will grant XP which will add up to unlock achievements
-Achievements for certain activities/XP level ups
-Add parent account to user profile
-Parents can add custom achievements (a simple input string)
-Idea: parents can sign up for a weekly summary email? Could be interesting
-Idea: links to pet care information
-Idea: pet weight calculator to determine how much food they should get
-Idea: custom pet icons
### Technologies
MVC, SQL database, maybe a few APIs
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to style an MVC project in a more exciting way than TechJobs, for example. It is important to me that my website looks nice.
